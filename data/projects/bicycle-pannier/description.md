## Problem

Ecobici is a bicycle share program in Mexico City, Mexico. The program is a great success, but the bicycles are not perfect, lacking a convenient space for carrying coats and jackets, books and school supplies, groceries, and others.


## Action

My pannier, the Swoop, is a simple but elegant answer to Ecobici’s storage issues. Injection molded polyethylene, drain holes for the weather, and simple riveted connections.


## Reasoning

Injection molding is an inexpensive production method. PE is durable, flexes, and takes color easily. The Swoop’s form meshes well with Ecobici’s design, and draws inspiration from jalepenos and other peppers, ocean waves, and even some curves from the human form.


## User Profile

Matsuko is an exchange student, studying Biomedical Science at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM). She is in her final year of studies, and the Ecobici program has been a great help for her. She uses it to get too and from classes, and to go downtown on her days off. One thing she’s wanted for a while though, is a little more space for her things, textbooks, groceries, and occasionally laundry.

She’ll be heading home after she graduates, and having the Ecobici program means she doesn’t have to worry about transporting or selling an expensive vehicle, or having it stolen.

Having a pannier on the Ecobici allows Matsuko to move her school supplies around, get groceries easily, and carry her other bags around without having to try to wear them and cycle at the same time.
