## Problem

Ecobici is a bicycle share program in Mexico City, Mexico. The program is a great success, but the bicycles are not perfect, lacking a convenient space for carrying coats and jackets, books and school supplies, groceries, and others.


## Action

My pannier, the Swoop, is a simple but elegant answer to Ecobici’s storage issues. Injection molded polyethylene, drain holes for the weather, and simple riveted connections.


## Reasoning

Injection molding is an inexpensive production method. PE is durable, flexes, and takes color easily. The Swoop’s form meshes well with Ecobici’s design, and draws inspiration from jalepenos and other peppers, ocean waves, and even some curves from the human form.
